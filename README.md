# Wacky Widgets

This is a CMS for widgets. It's really not that wacky. Logged in users can create, read, update and delete widgets from the browser, and a public REST API provides all public widgets or a single public widget as json. From the browser, logged in users can also publish all public widgets as static json to an AWS S3 bucket. The app is deployed at https://wackywidgets.herokuapp.com

### Setup:

This uses Ruby 2.6.3, Rails 6.0.2.1, and Postgres. Once your environment is configured including bundler, and the repo is cloned, run:
```
bundle install
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
```

To run the server on localhost:3000, run:
`rails s`

To run the tests, run:
`rspec`

Currently, users are only created from the command line. To enter the Rails console, run:
`rails c`

From the Rails console, create a user with this syntax:

`User.create(email: 'hello@example.com', password: 'Hello123!', name: 'Olleh')`

To setup AWS uploads from the locally running app, copy /config/amazon.yml.example to a new file called config/amazon.yml, which is gitignored, and add AWS credentials to the file.

### Endpoints:

GET /api/v1/widgets - all the public widgets

GET /api/v1/widgets/:id - a single widget

### Additional Features:

To view test coverage using SimpleCov, open /coverage/index.html in the browser after running the tests. This file is automatically generated and gitignored.

To view a data model visualization using ActiveDesigner, run:
`active_designer --create ./db/schema.rb`
and then open /active_designer/index.html. This file is gitignored.
